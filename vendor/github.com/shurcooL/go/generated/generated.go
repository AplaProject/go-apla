// Package generated provides a function that parses a Go file and reports
// whether it contains a "// Code generated â€¦ DO NOT EDIT." line comment.
//
// It implements the specification at https://golang.org/s/generatedcode.
//
// The first priority is correctness (no false negatives, no false positives).
// It must return accurate results even if the input Go source code is not gofmted.
//
// The second priority is performance. The current version uses bufio.Reader and
// ReadBytes. Performance can be optimized further by using lower level I/O
// primitives and allocating less. That can be explored later. A lot of the time
// is spent on reading the entire file without being able to stop early,
// since the specification allows the comment to appear anywhere in the file.
//
// Deprecated: This package has moved to dmitri.shuralyov.com/go/generated.
// Use that package instead.

// 	the regular expression, in Go syntax:
