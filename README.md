## Introduction
Genesis is an open-source blockchain platform, the basis of which was laid in 2011 by programmer Oleg Strelenko. The platform's code was written completely from the ground up. Currently, there is a team of over 15 top-tier software developers working on the project. We can't run an ICO for the concept of Genesis the way that we like, that's why we decided to give away 85% of all tokens to a maximum number of programmers, so that with the help of the community Genesis becomes the best blockchain platform in the world.

## Why is Genesis Unique?
 - In Genesis you can create your own blockchain ecosystem with customized rules. In essence, you can create your own "Ethereum", which can easily interact and communicate with your neighbor's "Ethereum" (another ecosystem on Genesis).
 - Developing applications on the Genesis platform is easy and fun. Mastering the platform's programming languages – Simvolio and Protypo - will take you around just four hours.
 - You'll be able to immediately upload your newly developed applications on Simvolio and Protypo directly to your mobile device running IOS or Android. You can do this using our application, which is soon to be available from Appstore and Google Play. Or you can upload your version after making some changes to our source codes.
 - All of the platform's parameters (even the consensus algorithm!) are fully customizable, and can be changed by community voting or by any other algorithms.

## Get Your Tokens, GitHub User!
To protect the platform from attacks, Genesis (just as other public blockchain platforms) charges payments in GEN tokens for use of the network resources. The platform's genesis block will emit 100 million tokens and 85% (85m GEN) will be distributed among 850 thousand GitHub users, whose accounts were created more than a year ago (to protect from bots). We choose this way of token distribution, because there are over 24 million GitHub users, and virtually all of them are software developers.
<br>
In order to further promote the process of engaging 850 thousand GitHub users, we have special bonuses for the early adopters:
<br>

- first 1,000 will receive 150 GEN each
- first 10,000 - 140 GEN
- first 100,000 - 120 GEN
- first 500,000 - 80 GEN
- all the rest - 70 GEN each

<br><p align="center"><b>Just give a star to this repository, and receive your tokens when the platform launches.
</b></p><br>

The star count will end on [date to be announced]. Before this date, post an [ECDSA public key](http://GenesisCommunity.github.io/newKeys.html) in your bio or post it as a pubic gist at https://gist.github.com/. If you use gist, please use genesis_public_key as the file name. We will parse your key and write it into the Genesis blockchain. Access to GEN tokens will be possible using private keys. In case there are some tokens left after the giveaway, the Genesis foundation will distribute the rest at their own discretion.<br> <br>


You can receive an extra +10 GEN if you write the login of a GitHub user who told you about Genesis (put it right after your public key in your GitHub BIO or in your public gist). Examples: ([GitHub BIO](https://github.com/c-darwin));  ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/c-darwin/c9daed5fcc589932c9be92e9c78dbd38)). This user will also receive an additional +10 GEN (if they place a [public ECDSA key](http://GenesisCommunity.github.io/newKeys.html) in their profile or post it on gist).<br> <br>

As a result, around 850 thousand programmers will take full control over the blockchain platform and will be able to start building a new world with new rules.<br> <br>

After starting the mainnet, GEN will be added to exchanges without any problems. By the way, currently there are no public blockchain platforms on the exchanges that allow for development of custom smart contracts, and that have the total cost of its coins amounting to less than $1 billion.

## Integration with GitHub
We plan on providing the option to pay for the approved pull requests and closed issues with GEN. In other words, you can integrate Genesis in your repository and automatically pay users, who help improve your product.<br>
Add our badge to your repository to support Genesis.<br>

## How Genesis Works
Develop your applications using [Simvolio](http://genesiskernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/script.html#simvolio-contracts-language). Simvolio is a С-like programming language used for creating contracts and which is compiled to byte code. It has a minimum required number of program control commands and predefined functions.
<p align="center">

</p><br>

Create interfaces using [Protypo](http://genesiskernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/templates2.html#protypo-template-language). Protypo is a language for creating frontend pages. It is in essence a template engine which transforms a sequence of functions with parameters into a tree structure with elements, which can be then used for the front-end.
